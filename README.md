        MINESWEEPER - Kenneth Howe, 2020
---------------------------------------------------

ABOUT:

This implementation of Minesweeper was created as
an assignment submission for the CS1181 (Computer
Science II) course at Wright State University.

Although it is just a first attempt at creating a
GUI in JavaFX, the game plays (mostly) like normal:


CONTROLS:

Left-click: Activate tile
Right-click: Toggle flag

ADDITIONAL:

- If the corresponding number of flags are placed
  in the neighborhood of a numbered tile (e.g. a
  tile labeled "2" with 2 flags around it), left-
  clicking the tile will clear all of its
  un-flagged neighbors.
